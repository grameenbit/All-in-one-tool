        <p>
            Welcome to "All in one tool" ("us", "we", or "our"), accessible from https://grameenbit.github.io/All-in-one-tool/. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not require you to register an account, and we do not ask for personal details like your name, email address, or phone number.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data You Provide to Tools:</strong> Our website is a static site (hosted on GitHub Pages). Most tools on this site operate entirely within your web browser (client-side). Any data, text, or files you input into our tools are processed locally in your browser. This data is **NOT** sent to, stored on, or processed by our servers.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Log Files and Analytics</h2>
        <p>
            Like many websites, we may use log files or third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to understand how our site is used. This information is non-personally identifiable and may include your IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. This data is used only to analyze trends, administer the site, and gather demographic information for internal use.
        </p>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            We do not use cookies to store information about visitors' preferences or personal data. Any third-party services like Google Analytics may use cookies, over which we have no control.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA)</h2>
        <p>
            Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2>Do Not Track (DNT)</h2>
        <p>
            Our website does not respond to "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals. As we do not track our users over time, DNT signals are not applicable.
        </p>

        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>
            Our website may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any third-party sites.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
        </p>
