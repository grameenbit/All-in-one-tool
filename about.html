        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to "All in one tool"! Our mission is to provide a comprehensive collection of simple, free, and effective online tools to make your daily digital tasks easier.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>
            We believe technology should be accessible to everyone. In a world where simple tasks often require downloading heavy software or navigating multiple complex websites, we wanted to create a single, reliable hub. Our goal is to provide useful utilities (like text tools, calculators, converters, etc.) all in one place, completely free of charge.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Offer</h3>
        <p>
            Our site features a growing library of tools across various categories.
            [For example: You'll find text manipulation tools like character counters and case converters, various calculators for everyday use, image converters, and much more. We are constantly working to add new and useful tools to our collection.]
        </p>

        <h3>Why Choose Us?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Completely Free:</strong> All our tools are available at no cost.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Friendly:</strong> We focus on a clean, simple, and intuitive interface that anyone can use.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure & Private:</strong> As a static site hosted on GitHub Pages, most of our tools run directly in your browser (client-side). This means the data you input is not sent to our servers, ensuring your privacy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Contact Us</h3>
        <p>
            We are always looking to improve. If you have any feedback, suggestions for new tools, or any questions, please feel free to reach out.
